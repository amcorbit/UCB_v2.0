This board was developed at the National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission (NCREPT) in collaboration with the University of Arkansas Power Group. It is an updated version of UCB v1.4a, which was developed by Dr. Chris Farnell. 

UCB v2.0 is an updated version of the existing UCB v1.4 architecture with additional features but a similar layout. 
The new version of the UCB includes an onboard SPI flash for storing and transferring information such as updated firmware. 
UCB v2.0 utilizes the Lattice MachXO3D FPGA instead of the MachXO2 for enhanced cybersecurity. 
The 100-Pin DIM slots on the original UCB v1.4 have been replaced with Texas Instrumentsâ€™180-pin HSEC8 interface, allowing for the TMS320F28335 single core DSPs to be replaced with the TMS320F28379D dual core DSPs.
When compared to the F28335 DSP, the F28379D DSP has two 32-bit CPUs, a faster 200 MHz clock speed, additional programmable GPIO pins, an increased number of Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) channels, a larger flash, three SPI modules, and a 16-bit ADC.

Abstract: Globally, new technological solutions are being studied and developed by researchers in the field of power and energy systems. Before these solutions can be integrated into society as marketable products, thorough testing and validation of the design must be conducted. 
The National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission (NCREPT) is a unique high-power test facility located at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA. NCREPT is a 12,000-square-foot laboratory space capable of testing power levels up to 6 MVA and offers testing at both the 480 V and 13.8 kV levels. 
NCREPT's capabilities expand outside of the scope of simply high-power testing. NCREPT has also supported experimental testing for transportation electrification, hardware-in-the-loop, and cybersecurity applications. 
NCREPT has personnel with experience testing new technologies and has demonstrated its innovative approaches by being a part of four R&D 100 award-winning projects. This paper gives an extensive overview of NCREPT, highlighting its significance as a state-of-the-art testing laboratory.
